## Data types, corresponding transfers/fees logic
`Order` data can be generic. `dataType` field defines format of that data.
- `"0xffffffff"` or `"no type"`
  - no data
  - fees logic
    - no fees 
- `"V1"`
  - fields
    - `LibPart.Part[] payouts`
      - array of payouts, i.e. how takeAsset of the order is going to be distributed. (usually 100% goes to order.maker, can be something like 50% goes to maker, 50% to someone else. it can be divided in any other way)
    - `LibPart.Part[] originFees`
      - additional fees (e.g. 5% of the payment goes to additional address)
  - fees logic
    - `originFees` from buy-order is taken from the buyer, `originFees` from sell-order is taken from the seller. e.g. sell order is `1 ERC721` => `100 ETH`, buy order is `100 ETH` => `1 ERC721`. Buy order has `originFees` = [`{5% to addr1}`,`{10% to addr2}`]. Sell order has `originFees` = [`{5% to addr3}`]. Then, total amount that buyer needs to send is `100 ETH` + `5%*100ETH` + `10%*100ETH` = `115 ETH` (15% more than order value, buy-order `origin fees` are added. So buyer pays for their `origin fees`). From this amount `5 ETH` will be transfered to addr1, `10 ETH` to addr2 (now we have `100ETH` left) and `5ETH` to addr3 (it is seller `origin fee`, so it is taken from their part).
    - after that NFT `royalties` are taken
    - what's left after that is distributed according to sell-order `payouts`
- `"V2"`
  - fields
    - `LibPart.Part[] payouts`, works the same as in `V1` orders
    - `LibPart.Part[] originFees`, works the same as in `V1` orders
    - `bool isMakeFill`
      - if false, order's `fill` (what part of order is completed, stored on-chain) is calculated from take side (in `V1` orders it always works like that)
      - if true, `fill` is calculated from the make side of the order
    - fees logic, works the same as in `V1` orders
- `"V3"` has the same structure as V2, but this order version means that protocol fee should be charged
  - fields
    - `LibPart.Part[] payouts`, works the same as in `V1` orders
    - `LibPart.Part[] originFees`, works the same as in `V1` orders
    - `bool isMakeFill`
      - if false, order's `fill` (what part of order is completed, stored on-chain) is calculated from take side (in `V1` orders it always works like that)
      - if true, `fill` is calculated from the make side of the order
    - fees logic, works the same as in `V1` orders

## Deprecated order versions

- `"V3_BUY"`
  - fields
    - `uint payouts`, works the same as in `V1` orders, but there is only 1 value and address + amount are encoded into uint (first 12 bytes for amount, last 20 bytes for address), not using `LibPart.Part` struct
    - `uint originFeeFirst`, instead of array there can only be 2 originFee in different variables (originFeeFirst and originFeeSecond), and address + amount are encoded into uint (first 12 bytes for amount, last 20 bytes for address), not using `LibPart.Part` struct
    - `uint originFeeSecond`, instead of array there can only be 2 originFee in different variables (originFeeFirst and originFeeSecond), and address + amount are encoded into uint (first 12 bytes for amount, last 20 bytes for address), not using `LibPart.Part` struct
    - `bytes32 marketplaceMarker`, bytes32 id marketplace, which generate this order
- `"V3_SELL"`
  - fields
    - `uint payouts`, works the same as in `V1` orders, but there is only 1 value and address + amount are encoded into uint (first 12 bytes for amount, last 20 bytes for address), not using `LibPart.Part` struct
    - `uint originFeeFirst`, instead of array there can only be 2 originFee in different variables (originFeeFirst and originFeeSecond), and address + amount are encoded into uint (first 12 bytes for amount, last 20 bytes for address), not using `LibPart.Part` struct
    - `uint originFeeSecond`, instead of array there can only be 2 originFee in different variables (originFeeFirst and originFeeSecond), and address + amount are encoded into uint (first 12 bytes for amount, last 20 bytes for address), not using `LibPart.Part` struct
    - `uint maxFeesBasePoint`
      - maximum amount of fees that can be taken from payment (e.g. 10%)
      - chosen by seller, that's why it's only present in `V3_SELL` orders
      - `maxFeesBasePoint` should be more than `0`
      - `maxFeesBasePoint` should not be bigger than `10%`
    - `bytes32 marketplaceMarker`, bytes32 id marketplace, which generate this order
- `V3` orders can only be matched if buy-order is `V3_BUY` and the sell-order is `V3_SELL`
- `V3` orders don't have `isMakeFill` field
  - `V3_SELL` orders' fills are always calculated from make side (as if `isMakeFill` = true)
  - `V3_BUY` orders' fills are always calculated from take side (as if `isMakeFill` = false)
- fees logic
  - `V3` orders' fees work differently from all previous orders types
  - `originFees` are taken from seller side only.
  - sum of buy-order `originFees` + sell-order `originFees` should not be bigger than `maxFeesBasePoint`
  - example:
    - sell order is `1 ERC721` => `100 ETH`
      - `maxFeesBasePoint` is 10 %
      - Sell order has `originFeeFirst` = `{2% to addr3}`
    - buy order is `100 ETH` => `1 ERC721`
      - Buy order has
        - `originFeeFirst` = `{3% to addr1}`,
        - `originFeeSecond` = `{2% to addr2}`
    - total amount for buyer is not affected by fees. it remains `100 ETH`
    - `3% * 100 ETH` + `2% * 100 ETH` is taken as buy order's origin fee, `95 ETH` remaining
    - `2% * 100 ETH` is taken as sell order's origin, `93 ETH` remaining
    - after that NFT `royalties` are taken (same as with previous orders' types)
    - what's left after that is distributed according to sell-order `payouts` (same as with previous orders' types)



## Data parsing

LibOrderData defines function parse which parses data field (according to dataType) and converts any version of the data to the GenericOrderData struct. 
(see [LibOrder](LibOrder.md) `Order.data` field)
