/**
 * This task iterates through ALL deployed contracts for the network specified via --network parameter.
 * 
 * The task expects contracts to follow OpenZeppelin's Ownable pattern if they implement ownership.
 * However, not all contracts need to be Ownable - the task handles both cases:
 * 
 * - For contracts that inherit from OpenZeppelin's Ownable: 
 *   The ownership transfer will be executed
 * 
 * - For non-Ownable contracts:
 *   They will be safely skipped without interrupting the task
 * 
 * This design ensures the task can process an entire deployment, transferring ownership
 * where possible while gracefully handling contracts that don't support ownership.
 * 
 * Sample usage:
 * 
 * npx hardhat transfer-ownership-all --new-owner "0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c" --network localhost
